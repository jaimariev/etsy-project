My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.

We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach.

I justify my collecting and treasure hunting with one simple quote &quot;Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.&quot;- William Morris. \r\n\r\nAt ANTHI LEONI DECOR I offer a combination of handmade gifts, painted furniture and vintage chic home decor for your interior design arrangements \r\n\r\n\u2764 From shabby chic style painted farmhouse country chairs to pretty custom painted assorted vintage picture frame sets, large ornate painted rococo style vision boards, chalkboards, magnetic boards and push pin boards. \r\n\r\n\u2764 vintage items include many art deco and retro home wares and eclectic antique curios, vintage suitcases and retro vanity cases - vintage coloured glass and barware, vintage china tea trios and my large and growing collection of vintage kitchenalia. \r\n\r\nI spend many wonderful hours sourcing vintage finds, from antique markets and fairs, table top sales and just about anywhere I think I can uncover a hidden gem to bring to you. Are you looking for something specific? As I do love a treasure hunt.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM ORDERS!\r\nDon&#39;t see what you want - Convo me about your custom order today, I&#39;d love to hear from you. And of course I love to paint furniture to match your own home styling. I stencil and decoupage too!  \r\n\r\nI have taught numerous furniture painting technique classes and have been painting furniture with chalk paint for many years so you can rest assured that I will produce a quality piece of painted furniture. I have also used a great variety of brands but my chalk paint of preference is Frenchic Furniture Paint which has no hidden nasties, and is an all natural, environmentally friendly, chalk and mineral paint. It is ZERO VOC and SOLVENT FREE with no odour. I stock 25 colours and the paint gives a smooth chalky finish. It is a thick and rich paint with superior coverage. All my furniture is finished with a soft wax for a luxurious sheen and a finishing coat is used to seal any top surfaces. If you have a custom requirement and need to match a specific chalk paint colour or brand I am happy to take larger orders using Annie Sloane, Little Greene, Autentico or Rustoleum and to match your needs but unless requested I use Frenchic.","currency_code":"GBP","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"Thank you so much for purchasing an item from my shop.

Your ring will have a similar look to those in the pictures - charred oak wood - but each ring is a unique piece of wood with it&#39;s own unique patterning with no two exactly alike!  Please note the variability in coloring in the photos - due to the charring process, your ring may be lighter or darker than the first image!\n\nThis is the charred wood option for this ring - if you&#39;d prefer a lighter ring, check out my natural version here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/278011450\/\n\nAfter a Jack Daniels barrel is no longer of use to the distillery, it is sold to a number of craftsmen who make everything from planters to knife handles from the wood - or, in this case, a solid wood ring.   I purchase the barrels straight from the distillery general store and have them shipped to my doorstep, where I dismantle them into individual staves to be cut into rings.\n  \n\nEach ring is hand polished and finished with several layers of cyanoacrylate.  While many crafters use oils and waxes to finish their rings, cyanoacrylate provides a stronger bond within the wood grain, provides protection from water, and reduces the likelihood of scratching - a common issue with other finishing materials.\n\nTo order a pair of rings:  add the first ring to your cart with the correct size\/shape information, return to this page, then add another ring with the second size\/shape information.\n\nDimensions:\nRing Size:  5-13.  If you need a larger or smaller size, please inquire using the &quot;Ask a Question&quot; button in the Cart area of the page.\nWidth:  5mm-9mm\nShape:  Rounded or flat profile.  Most people find that the rounded profile is more comfortable during the initial phase of getting used to wearing your ring, but this is largely an aesthetic choice.\n\nProcessing information:  Please allow 3-5 business days to create your ring prior to shipping.  If you are in need of rush service, please contact me prior to purchase.  I can, at times, accommodate quicker processing times!\n\nAs with all wood rings, this material is less durable than a traditional metal ring, but with proper care and maintenance, it will look beautiful and last for years!\n\nSize exchanges:  We offer the first size exchange free for residents of the United States (return shipping of the original is your responsibility).  Further alterations to size will incur an additional fee to cover the cost of shipping and handling.","creation_tsz":1475877769,"ending_tsz":1486508569,"original_creation_tsz":1448636802,"last_modified_tsz":1475877769,"price":"50.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":10,"tags":["Mens Wedding Band","Engagement Ring","Womens Ring","Couples Rings","Wood Ring","Wood Anniversary","Tennessee Whiskey","Whiskey Barrel Ring","Reclaimed Wood","Wooden Ring","American Oak Wood","Wooden Jewelry","Wood Wedding Ring"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Ring"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,69152047],"materials":["whiskey barrel"],"shop_section_id":19248734,"featured_rank":1,"state_tsz":1475505971,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/258181398\/tennessee-whiskey-barrel-wood-ring?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":26669,"num_favorers":2205,"shipping_template_id":22716839096,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"3","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":"2","item_width":"2","item_height":"1","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1232,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Rings","Bands"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":890819888,"hex_code":"8D8078","red":141,"green":128,"blue":120,"hue":23,"saturation":14,"brightness":55,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1450468212,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.890819888_ewsk.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.890819888_ewsk.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.890819888_ewsk.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.890819888_ewsk.jpg","full_height":640,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":952405166,"hex_code":"6F5741","red":111,"green":87,"blue":65,"hue":29,"saturation":41,"brightness":43,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459817834,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.952405166_eg38.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.952405166_eg38.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.952405166_eg38.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.952405166_eg38.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":952405330,"hex_code":"503D2B","red":80,"green":61,"blue":43,"hue":29,"saturation":46,"brightness":31,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459817834,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.952405330_apo2.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.952405330_apo2.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.952405330_apo2.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.952405330_apo2.jpg","full_height":667,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":890579399,"hex_code":"91683E","red":145,"green":104,"blue":62,"hue":30,"saturation":57,"brightness":56,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1450468212,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.890579399_cuvp.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.890579399_cuvp.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.890579399_cuvp.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.890579399_cuvp.jpg","full_height":640,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":898959456,"hex_code":"673C18","red":103,"green":60,"blue":24,"hue":27,"saturation":76,"brightness":40,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452115874,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.898959456_rqhe.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.898959456_rqhe.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.898959456_rqhe.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.898959456_rqhe.jpg","full_height":667,"full_width":1000}],"Shop":{"shop_id":11484887,"shop_name":"HawkinsHandicrafts","user_id":70492310,"creation_tsz":1439844033,"title":"Handcrafted Wood Rings","announcement":"Thanks for visiting the shop!

Clean with a wet cloth or paper towel.\n\nThe finish on your wood ring may eventually scratch and need repair.  While it may sound intimidating, this process is very easy and only requires a few supplies - liquid superglue, paper towels, and sand paper or polishing grits.  For detailed step-by-step instructions, please send me a message and I would be happy to provide them!\n\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\nRings are placed inside of a small AMAC (transparent plastic) jewelry box (bamboo rings come in a sustainably produced cardboard box) lined with cotton.

We do not offer additional gift wrapping at this time.\n\nRETURNS\nContact must be made with me prior to returns to ensure any issues are handled prior to shipping and to alert me to look for a package.  Returned rings should be placed inside their original jewelry box and then placed into a cushioned mailing envelope (available in the shipping supplies at your local post office).  Shipping may be done via USPS First Class for locations within the US to provide a cheap option that still provides tracking information.  Canada residents are strongly encouraged to utilize shipping with tracking and insurance for your protection in the case of a lost or stolen package.\n\nDAMAGED OR LOST ITEMS DURING SHIPPING\nPlease contact me immediately if you suspect a package has been lost or misdelivered.  Make certain that you&#39;ve checked with family members and neighbors, and looked in likely spots where a package may have been left.  Call your local post office in the case of a misdelivery so that they can track down your package and correct the delivery.\n\nIf your item has been damaged during shipping, you must keep both the damaged item and packaging, be willing to take photos of the damage, and fill out forms from our insurer in order to process your replacement\/refund in a timely manner.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1458102341,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/HawkinsHandicrafts?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/11484887\/iusb_760x100.16085161_ex88.jpg","num_favorers":494,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/11484887\/isla_fullxfull.21321770_9vw36xtr.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":1}},{"listing_id":211864696,"state":"active","user_id":36290105,"category_id":68901592,"title":"Vintage Two-page Mr. Boston Holiday Ad","description":"Vintage two-page ad for Mr. Boston liquor.

We have had issues importing these items to Australia and the UK. \n\nOther countries may have similar laws, please be familiar with your local laws, as we cannot be responsible if your package is seized by customs in your country.\n\nDO YOU OFFER MOCK UPS OR PROOFS?\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide proofs or mock ups except on orders with custom designed artwork. Requests for proofs will be disregarded unless you have paid for custom designed artwork. We copy and paste your text for engraving directly into the template chosen, preventing any typographical errors on our part. If we do make a mistake on the engraving and do not engrave as you instruct, we will correct it immediately and free of charge!\n\nVINYL DECALS\nOur vinyl decals are cut from industrial sign grade vinyl that is rated for 6 years of full weather outdoor use, and lifetime interior use. The vinyl decals look fantastic, providing a stencil painted look on your wall without the mess.\n\nBecause vinyl decals are custom made in your size and color we cannot offer returns. Vinyl decals can become damaged during installation if handled improperly. If you did not get instructions, are having trouble installing a decal, or are unsure of your ability to install one, (normally larger ones require experience or an extra hand) please stop installation and contact us. Any local sign professional can install these with ease - we cannot be responsible if the decal is damaged during installation.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1467758642,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"Thank you for contacting us.

","policy_payment":"All purchases and reserve listings must be paid within 3 days. Non-payment will result in cancellation and your order will return to my shop.\n\nI accept PayPal and Direct Checkout (where you can pay with: Visa, Master Card, American Express, and Discover cards). \n\nI am located in Arizona so a sales tax of 6.1% is automatically added to all sales shipped to a Arizona address. \n\nFor custom orders I require payment in full before I start handcrafting your order.  Custom orders can not be returned\/refunded. Thank you for understanding.  \n\nI go out of pocket for all my expenses.  Orders that are canceled or not paid for really hurt my little budget.  I&#39;m not a big company but a stay at home mom who makes everything from scratch and I appreciate your understanding!","policy_shipping":"Items typically ship in 3-5 business days.  If expedited shipping is needed, please contact me for details.\n\nI ship on Mondays, Tuesdays and sometimes on Wednesdays.  If you request that I ship your item on a specific day I can, but please keep in mind that orders which include live plants need to arrive asap.  Plants do not do well if they end up sitting at the post office, or in a postal truck, on a weekend or postal holiday.  \n\n**Does it look like Etsy is charging too much for shipping? **  \nShipping charges are calculated by Etsy using total weight, distance traveled from Arizona and shipping method selected.  I don&#39;t make money on shipping!  If shipping charges seem excessive contact me and I can look at ways to reduce the cost such as combining your items for shipment, shipping extremely heavy orders with FedEx or using a slower shipping method.  Contact me before your items ship and I will do my best to combine your items for shipping.  I can&#39;t know exact shipping charges until your items are handcrafted and packaged.  If you are overcharged for shipping by Etsy I will refund the difference once your order is packaged for shipment.  :)\n\nI use USPS Priority Mail which usually takes 2-4 business days to arrive depending on your location, but these times are NOT guaranteed by USPS.  Sorry but I can&#39;t be responsible if the shipping company delivers late so please order in time for your special event.\n\nI will replace your bottle if it arrives broken by the post office (If you shipped with Priority Mail that includes shipping insurance or if you paid for insurance to be added to your USPS Ground shipping).  Please let me know with in 3 days of arrival so I can file an insurance claim.  Within 3 days of your bottle&#39;s arrival I must also have pictures of the box, tracking  #, pictures of the broken bottle and the packaging.  Once the post office approves the claim (~1-2 weeks) I will send you a new bottle.  ** Please do NOT throw away your broken item or the box\/packaging material.**  The post office may ask you to bring the broken item and box to the post office so they can see it.  They may reject the insurance claim if you cannot show them those items!  Usually claims go right through but in one case they did ask the buyer to produce those items.  Sorry this is something I wish neither of us ever had to deal with!!!\n \nPlease be aware of climate conditions in your area at the time you order. MOST PLANTS WILL DIE IF EXPOSED TO TEMPERATURES BELOW 40F.  Heat packs can be purchased to travel in your shipment. (NO refunds for buyers who decide to opt out from purchasing a HEAT PACK during the winter months.) I cannot be held responsible for damage in transit due to cold, extreme heat or USPS delays. Please be aware of weather conditions when ordering.  Thank you for understanding.\n\nPlease be aware that you are purchasing a living thing and plan accordingly. You need to open the box as soon as it arrives.  Plants left in the dark in a box can change colors, elongate and\/or DIE.  \n\nYOU WILL BE SENT A TRACKING NUMBER.  PLEASE WATCH FOR YOUR PLANT&#39;S ARRIVAL AND MAKE SURE IT ISN&#39;T LEFT OUT IN A HOT\/COLD MAILBOX\/DOORSTEP.  You may be able to have the post office hold your boxes for pickup at your local post office. \n\nIf you ordered an air plant, depending on your location, they may need to be sprayed with non-chlorinated water daily or dipped in water every other day.  So please let your new plant friends out of their box and give them a drink!  As you know, too much or too little water, the wrong soil or incorrect lighting can kill a plant so PLEASE SEE INCLUDED CARE SHEETS. Cactus, succulents and air plants are usually VERY tough but even they need a little love and the right care.  Sorry but after 48 hours of receiving them I cannot issue any refunds.\n\nI carefully wrap the succulents and cushion them in tissue and\/or kraft paper for protection. For my potted items, sometimes soil will get loose from the pot. Simply brush off the plant, replace the soil if needed, and lightly pack it around the roots (never plant air plants in soil).  For cactus I would suggest using a plastic spoon to safely replace the soil and handling the cactus every so gently with tongs or leather gloves if you feel the need for direct contact.\n\n\nEnsure that your correct address is listed on Etsy and Paypal and that those addresses match each other because that address is where I&#39;m sending your package unless you specify that this order is a gift and you want it sent to a separate address.    Because of the perishable nature of my products, shipments to incorrect addresses will void any and all guarantees.  If you accidentally ship to an incorrect address, and if the item(s) are returned to me, the buyer would be responsible for the additional shipping charges to re-ship the item.\n\nThe shipping cost is automatically calculated at checkout based on the zip code of the shipping destination provided and includes postage, delivery confirmation, online tracking, packaging\/handling and standard USPS insurance. You will receive an email notification when your order has shipped. For orders greater than $100 I can add additional insurance.  You are responsible for letting me know if you&#39;d like a signature confirmation or insurance on your order for an additional cost.  \n\n\nFor items with live plants, shipping is only available to the 48 contiguous states. Live plants cannot ship to APO, AE, or any other military addresses; PO Boxes; any international address.\n\nCUSTOMS AND IMPORT TAXES:\nBuyers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply.  I&#39;ve heard from buyers that countries like the UK do charge an import tax.  Sorry I have no way of finding out if you will be charged an import tax or how much it would be.  I&#39;m not responsible for delays due to customs.","policy_refunds":"Your purchase is refundable if you are unhappy but unfortunately shipping costs and other fees are not refundable.  Just mail back your product, at your expense, and I can send you a different item or I can give you a refund.  \r\n\r\nI take pride in what I make and I want you to be happy!  Please give me the chance to make it right before you leave negative feedback.  \r\n\r\n","policy_additional":"For the sake of my sanity and because I&#39;m chasing 2 very little children, PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF THE IMAGES IN MY LISTINGS ARE STOCK PHOTOS.  \r\n\r\nSORRY BUT NO PLANT IS GUARANTEED TO LOOK EXACTLY LIKE ITS LISTING PHOTOS, AND NOT LOOKING LIKE THE PHOTO IS NOT A BASIS FOR A REFUND. I would have to take photos of each plant daily because they are living things and go through changes.  Some cactus, most succulents, and some tillandsias (air plants) change color depending on sun exposure or lack of, hot or cold temperatures, and stress. They also have varying bloom and propagation cycles which will affect their appearance.  So they may be in bloom in the photo but may not arrive in bloom to your house.  No worries, take good care of them and I bet you see them bloom during their next bloom cycle.  The pictures just show you what they will look like when they bloom.\r\n\r\nIf you need a larger quantity than I have listed, please send me a convo and I will quote you a price. \r\n\r\nLabels on glass bottles:  \r\nThe quality of bottle labels can not be guaranteed because we are giving new life to a used bottle that otherwise would have spent nearly 1 million years in a landfill!  True!  If the quality of the label or the color of the foil on the bottle neck is important please let me know and I will do my best to find a bottle that is just right for you.  \r\n\r\nGlass bottles: \r\nEach bottle is a hand-worked piece of art and as such each bottle is slightly different in color, wall thickness, shape....  I spend long hours sanding and polishing my bottles, and I take pride in them, but some will have a small chip here and there on the edge from the LONG and labor intensive process of upcycling your bottle.  These small scratches\/dings\/chips are usually well concealed when the bottle is planted.  This is glass that was not originally intentioned for it&#39;s new purpose in life so PLEASE HAND WASH AND DO NOT PUT IN THE DISHWASHER.  Enjoy!
